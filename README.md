# Gravitational Wave with Deep Learning Project

Welcome to the **Gravitational Wave with Deep Learning Project** repository! 🚀  
This repository contains a complete Deep Learning pipeline for analyzing **gravitational wave (GW)** time-series data from LIGO using **deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**.  
The project processes raw strain data, converts it into spectrograms, and trains a CNN model to estimate source parameters such as **mass₁, mass₂, and luminosity distance**.

## 📁 Project Overview

**Pipeline Summary:**
1. 🛰️ **Download GW Data** from [GWTC Catalog](https://www.gw-openscience.org/eventapi/html/GWTC/).
2. 🧩 **Extract Strain Files** (`L1`) and preprocess them.
3. 🎧 **Generate Simulated Noise** and synthetic GW signals using PyCBC.
4. 🔬 **Convert Time-Series → Spectrograms** using `scipy.signal.spectrogram` + TensorFlow resizing.
5. 🧠 **Train a CNN** to predict GW event properties.
6. 📊 **Visualize Results**: Loss curves, and model architecture.
